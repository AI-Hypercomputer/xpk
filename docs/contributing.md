Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Contribution process

## Steps

0. <Optionally needed> Create a virtual environment:

Optionally use a venv to set up and develop xpk. This is needed for Google
internal xpk development from a cloudtop machine.

```shell
# Create venv if needed.
## One time step of creating the venv
VENV_DIR=~/venvp3
python3 -m venv $VENV_DIR
## enter the venv.
source $VENV_DIR/bin/activate
```

1. Install developer tools including `pyink`, `pylint`, and `precommit` using

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/xpk.git
pip install .[dev]
```

2. Install git hook scripts.
```shell
pre-commit install
# Optionally run against files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

3. Support auto-formatting when committing changes!
```shell
# 1. Code will be autoformatted on:
git commit -m "My cool new feature"
# 2. If code needs to be reformatted, check what changes were made, and add them to the commit.
git add -p
# 3. Run git commit again, which should successfully pass pre-commit checks.
git commit -m "My cool new feature"


# If you need, you can also manually format code by running:
pyink .
```

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.

### Testing
Unit Tests for XPK coming soon.

### Code style
Before pushing your changes, you need to lint the code style via `pyink`. This
is handled through `pre-commit` if you have that installed.

To install `pyink`:

```sh
pip3 install pyink==24.3.0
```

To lint the code:

```sh
# Format files in the local directory.
pyink .
# Check if files need to be formatted.
pyink --check .
```
