pip install xpk
```

If you see an error saying: `This environment is externally managed`, please use a virtual environment. For example:

```shell
# One time step of creating the virtual environment
VENV_DIR=~/venvp3
python3 -m venv $VENV_DIR

# Activate your virtual environment
source $VENV_DIR/bin/activate

# Install XPK in virtual environment using pip
pip install xpk
```

## Installation from source

To install XPK from source, first install required tools mentioned in [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [additional prerequisites](#additional-prerequisites-when-installing-from-source). Afterwards you can install XPK from source using `make`
