## CPU usage

In order to use XPK for CPU, you can do so by using `device-type` flag.

*   Cluster Create (provision on-demand capacity):

    ```shell
    # Run cluster create with on demand capacity.
    python3 xpk.py cluster create \
    --cluster xpk-test \
    --device-type=n2-standard-32-256 \
    --num-slices=1 \
    --default-pool-cpu-machine-type=n2-standard-32 \
    --on-demand
    ```
    Note that `device-type` for CPUs is of the format <cpu-machine-type>-<number of VMs>, thus in the above example, user requests for 256 VMs of type n2-standard-32.
    Currently workloads using < 1000 VMs are supported.

*   Run a workload:

    ```shell
    # Submit a workload
    python3 xpk.py workload create \
    --cluster xpk-test \
    --num-slices=1 \
    --device-type=n2-standard-32-256 \
    --workload xpk-test-workload \
    --command="echo hello world"
    ```
