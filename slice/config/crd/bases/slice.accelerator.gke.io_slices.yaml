                  Required, set of nodes to use to form a slice.
                  NodeSelector specifies a set of label-based selectors for nodes that can form the
                  slice. The controller will select nodes where for each key-value pair in the map,
                  the node's label value for that key is present in the corresponding string slice.
                  This allows for a flexible "match any of these values for this label" selection.
                  The nodeSelector will follow an AND over the map entries but an OR within the list
                  items of the entry.
                  For example, to select nodes in cubes cube-1 and cube-2, you could use:
                  {"cloud.google.com/gke-tpu-reservation-subblock": ["cube-1", "cube-2"]}
