r"""xpk (Accelerated Processing Kit).

Next Steps:
- Cluster describe is broken by Cacheimage since that counts as a workload.
- Cluster describe: count by jobset.
- If any instance goes down, bring down the whole job.
- How to more gracefully handle job failures, distinguishing between software
  and infra?
- Look into --docker-name and --docker-image.
  Shouldn't one string be adequate to express what we want?
- Apply learnings from about private, region, coredns, etc:
- Enable special preheater
- Make Argparse logic this a function?
  - Obvious logic that starts in main instead of here in code but args will
    not be a universal argument.
